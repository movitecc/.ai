2. Update the Codex: `@learn.md`

### Important Note

@codex.md should be added to the context of every chat:

- For regular chats: Use the plus button at the top of the chat to add the file.
- For Composers: Add the file to a Project Composer so all Composers created in that project will automatically have the file.

### Structure

The Codex (`codex.md`) is divided into two main sections:

1. Errors: Mistakes made and how to prevent them.
2. Learnings: Insights gained and their applications.

Each entry includes context, description, correction/application, and related entries.
